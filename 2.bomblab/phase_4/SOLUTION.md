# What's in phase_4?

- In phase_4, the number of the input is restricted to 2.
- phase_4 will check if the value of input[1] is below 14. If not, bomb.
- phase_4 will call func_4 after set some registers.
- func_4 is recursive, but can quit in the first loop.
- Maybe more features about func_4 later
